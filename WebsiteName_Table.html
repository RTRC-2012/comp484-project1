<p>These are just some of the cars with the best ratings for 2023. As you can see, there's
quite a <i>range</i> of mileage cars are capapble of, given their different sizes and prices.</p>

<p>It is important to note that range is not directly tied to the car's price. Notice how a 24-grand 
Chevy Bolt EUV has the same range as an 88-grand Porsche Taycan. The increased price is not
because one car is more efficient, but because everything else about it is more luxury oriented.
The Lucid Air, meanwhile, costs just $1000 more than the Porshe and has more than double the
range of either, so clearly there's more going on that determines car prices.</p>
<p>Why don't we explore some of those reasons?</p>

  <search> <!-- Search, Button, and Nonvalidate -->
    <form action="./search/">
      <label for="movie">also feel free to look up other cars' info beyond these examples</label>
      <input type="search" id="movie" name="q"/>

    </form>

<br>

<div ID="essay2">
<p>Consider that Lucid Motors is relatively new in the car space; they started in 2007 as Atieva
by making electric motors and batteries for other companies. Porsche is instead a long-standing
name that is trying something new in the Taycan. Given the differences between these vehicles'
range, to still pick the Taycan would come down to other factors like reliability and maintanance cost,
as well as more subjective things like brand loyalty/recognition or exterior and interior styling.</p>
<p>However, many electric cars are often expensive and luxurious, so perhaps this comparison between these sporty EVs is not so useful. This is just considering a <i>new</i> car, because in theory you'd want to have the best performance and battery efficiency you can get. Even if something like the Chevy Bolt EUV is still more expensive than you'd like, there is always the option of used cars too. When you look at the options on the table, it's worth making sure you know what kinds of cars are out there.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div ID="essay2">
<p>You may have heard of different types of engine setups and drivetrains in ICE cars. In case you're unfamiliar, the main types are:</p>
<li><b>FF: </b> engine is in front and powers the front wheels</li>
<li><b>FR: </b> engine is in front and powers the rear wheels</li>
<li><b>MR: </b> engine is behind the seats but between the axles, and powers the rear wheels</li>
<li><b>RR: </b> engine is on the rear axle and powers the rear wheels</li>
<li><b>4WD/AWD: </b> engine is typically in the front and powers all four wheels</li>
<p>Each has their own reasons and benefits, not to mention the difference between a manual or automoatic transmission. While MF and RF layouts have been used in the past, they are not typically seen on modern cars. A key difference between AWD and 4WD sysyems is that AWD is always active to share torque between the axles, whereas 4WD is part-time and usually needs to be engaged by the driver when appropriate.</p>
<p>The number of cylynders in the engine and how much horsepower it produces is also a major factor of the cars's efficiency, if not moreso. But the drivetrain and engine are both worthy considerations if you're specifically looking for an ICE car.<p>
</div>

<br>
<div ID="essay2">
<p>The concept of different motors and drivetrains is also applicable to electric cars in four main setups:<p>
<ul class="battery">
<li><b>Single-motor:</b> only front or rear wheels are powered</li>
<li><b>Dual-motor:</b> balanced so front and rear is powered</li>
<li><b>Tri-motor:</b> rear or front biased by having two motors there</li>
<li><b>Quad-motor:</b> a motor dedicated to each wheel</li>
</ul></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6H5vtu5_SF4?si=dtz7HD-yxflBVzkn&t=474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linked here</a> is a video from The 
Engineers Post that goes into more detail about these layouts and the different motors that can be used, 
but the main point is that the different price and range of these cars also comes down to the
setup the manufacturer builds it with. Some have only one option while others can be bought with options if the manufacturer offers them, like Tesla. These can lead to different performace stats and how it feels on the road.</p>
<p>It should also be noted how horsepower for electric cars is calculated, where every one kilowatt is equivalent to about 1.34 hp, inversely one mechanical horsepower is about 745.7 Watts</p>

<p><strong>kW ↔ hp Converter</strong></p> <!-- use var for kW to hp converter -->

</div>


<br>
<div ID="essay2">
<p>Also notice in the table how some hybrid cars have a lot more range than ones with only one powertrain.
This is because they use both EV and ICE in conjunction. This is great for increasing how far the car can go before
needing to recharge and/or refuel, and in some cases, making them more performance oriented. Some of the world's best supercars
are hybrids in some form because the electric motors have instant torque and better acceleration, but the gas
engine can achieve a higher top speed and more consistent acceleration as it reaches that.
The different kinds of hybrids are:</p>
<ul class="battery">
<li><b>Mild: </b>uses an electric motor to lift some burden off the gas engine, increasing efficiency</li>
<li><b>Full: </b>the gas and electric motors are equally capable on their own, resulting in better performance</li>
<li><b>Plug-In: </b>batteries can charge by both internal and external means, otherwise similar to Full hybrids</li>
<li><b>EV + Range Extender: </b>small gas engine does not power the wheels directly, but is instead only a generator for recharging the batteries</li>
</ul><p>
For the sake of brevity, we have grouped these various types of EVs and Hybrids under their own umbrellas. Sometmes it does matter to differentiate them, but most of the time it's okay to generallize the concepts somewhat. The only element you should <i>always</i> be mindful of is if the hybrid car you want is Plug-In or not, that way you can plan ahead with how you'll be using it in your day-to-day life.
